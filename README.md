# Online_voting_system_using_Blockchain

This online voting system aims to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof method for conducting elections. The system utilizes blockchain technology to achieve this. The blockchain serves as a public ledger where all voting transactions are recorded and stored in multiple locations, making it virtually impossible to alter the data.

The system allows voters to cast their votes using their computers or mobile devices, and the votes are encrypted and stored in the blockchain. The results are then calculated and displayed in real-time, providing an accurate and verifiable record of the election results.

# Features

01.Secure: The use of blockchain technology ensures that the voting process is secure and transparent.

02.Convenient: The system allows voters to cast their votes from anywhere, at any time, using their computer or mobile device.

03.Tamper-Proof: The immutability of the blockchain makes it virtually impossible for anyone to alter the voting results.

04.Transparent: The results of the election are displayed in real-time, providing a transparent and verifiable record of the election results.

# Tech Stack

01Blockchain: The system utilizes blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency, and tamper-proofing of the voting process.

02.Cryptography: The system uses cryptographic techniques to encrypt the votes and ensure their confidentiality.

03.Web Application: The system is built as a web application, making it accessible to voters from anywhere and on any device.
